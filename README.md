# Apriori-Algorithm-Python
This is my implementation of the Apriori Algorithm in Python 2.7.
Please have the database file saved as a text file in the same root directory as the apriori.py file.
To run the program please run the following command in the python shell: 
python apriori.py


When prompted please enter the support value, confidence value and file name of the database: 

For example: 

python apriori.py

Enter the Minimum Support Value %: 10

Enter the Minimum Confidence Value %: 40

Enter the name for the Database: Database_1.txt

It should give you the database and the relevant Association Rules that go along with it.
